# JoltingTrims
A Minecraft plugin that'll provide easy usage on armor trims for styling player armors!

Anybody that is interested in seeing new and interesting features, for sure saw the new Trimming Feature on a video or a changelog page and was thrilled with that new addition. I know I did. But then I thought about that... What if you don't have a survival server or something that fits the vanilla-like experience but still want to use that amazing feature? What do you do then? The answer is this plugin! A good-looking system that can fit in any type of server that wants to offer its players some extra customization to give them one more goal to aim for or a bit more immersion in the gameplay! Besides the quality of life addition that this plugin provides, it also provides permission-based materials and patterns. So do you wish for your players to complete a quest and get a special pattern as a reward? What about buying a specific rank and getting a combination of patterns and materials in return? You name it!​
